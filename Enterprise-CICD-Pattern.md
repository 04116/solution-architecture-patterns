## Enterprise Continous Integration Continous Deployment (CICD) Pattern

### Introduction
Enterprise deployments used to span across several teams and took more time than it was ever required. The mismatch of timelines, goals, resources and skills made it really hard to do a release within the enterprise in a given date. It would have been fine when there was little competition in the market. But that time has come to an end and the competition has become ever so large that some competitors do deployments and releases several times within a day. These modern enterprises have followed up the "Continous Integration(CI)/ Continous Deployment (CD)" pattern when implementing enterprise software. 

### Advantages of CI/CD within enterprise
