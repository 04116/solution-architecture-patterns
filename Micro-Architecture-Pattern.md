## Micro Architecture Pattern

### Introduction
Microservices Architecture (MSA) is becoming the SOA of the modern era. Like the way SOA improved the enterprise software architecture with new patterns and architectures around that, Microservices Architecture (MSA) has tripped off several new architectural styles and new concepts around how people build enterprise software. Some of them are

- Service Mesh  — Technique to communicate amongst microservices
- Serverless  — Running your code as functions on cloud
- Micro Integration  — Run your integrations as microservices
- Micro Gateway  — Run your api gateways in a microservices compatible manner


All these architectures can be categorized under the common umbrella of "microservices" and if we can identify an architecture style which supports all these different micro-micro architectures, that can be called as micro architecture.
