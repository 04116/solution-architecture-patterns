# Multi Cloud Enterprise Deployment Pattern

## Introduction
Enterprises are expanding their IT operations to match with the consumer demand and to become the leader in their respective industries. Cloud has provided a reliable platform to these enterprises to run their business operations without much hassle. Few years ago, Amazon Web Services or AWS was the only choice people had when they want to deploy their applications in a cloud environment. But the market has been changed and there are many other vendors who offers cloud infrastructure at a competitive price. This allowed the enterprises to choose the best cloud environment for a given task rather than locking into a single vendor. 

### Advantages
Instead of running all your business functionality in a single cloud or on-premise platform, running on multiple clouds give enterprises many advantages. Here are few advantages.

- Provides much better service availability - Given that your applications are running across mutiple cloud environments, your services can run without much interruption even if an entire cloud system goes down. 

- Get enterprises free from vendor lock-in - Cloud vendors always try to get as much applications into their own cloud and that will lock you into a single vendor so that you cannot get away from them even you need to do it. With the multi-cloud approach, you don't need to lock into any vendor and move away from them at any time. 

- Can negotiate for better deals - Once you are in multi cloud, you have more power to demand for discounts since every vendor wants to increase their share of your account. 

- Can use best technology for the applications - Different cloud vendors are strong in different areas. When you have a multi cloud strategy, you can select the best technology for your task which is provided by the resective cloud vendor.

- Can provide better performance to consumers - Your applications can run on multiple clouds and expose the functionality through cloud gateways which are closed to the consumers in relevant cloud deployments based on locations.
